# HC_SG85_Sleep_Paralysis

scraaaa

doing what you’d not do, seeing
flashes of light, you blinded and shining
nonsense through and through
burning my brain at night 

can’t sleep it off, can’t talk
with no emotions just emojis
my biggest weakness here
i  give a fuck, 

tricksters and jokers abound, in the eye
put forth my mind burning till i close
damn you laughs and halftruths
rationale lost in the woods
card tricks not for the weak 
card tricks not for the weak 
can’t play with illusion
when i just want to finally sleep

shouldn’t i care for the abused
care for the souls of the weak
make them grow despite
 their downward peak

shouldn’t i care for the abused
care for the souls of the weak
make them grow despite
 their downward peak

doing what you’d not do, seeing
flashes of light, you blinded and shining
nonsense through and through
burning my brain at night 
can’t sleep it off, can’t talk 
with no emotions just emojis 

my biggest weakness here
i  give a fuck, 

tricksters and jokers abound, in the eye
put forth my mind burning till i close
damn you laughs and halftruths
rationale lost in the woods
card tricks not for the weak 
card tricks not for the weak 
can’t play with illusion
when i just want to finally sleep
